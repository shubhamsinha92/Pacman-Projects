Provisional grades
==================
Question q4: 0/5
------------------
Total: 0/5

Your grades are NOT yet registered.  To register your grades you must
submit your files to the edX website.  The grades obtained through the
edX website are your final grades unless your submission was not in
the spirit of the course,  such as if your submission simply hardcoded
the answers to the tests.   We will screen for this after the deadline.

*If you worked with a partner, you must both submit separately.*
